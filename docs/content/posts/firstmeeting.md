## The first Meeting

In our first meeting we defined what a learning community is for us, which model we are using. Besides this we defined our personal goals and the over arching goal. The later is a tower defense game. It is meant to guide us in a direction to give us fuel for our research and prototypes.



## The method

As method we chose the learning community methodology as the basis for our research. We chose the guided learning community, in which the supervisor takes the role as guide, source validator. Their job is it to ensure the quality of the research sources and generally guiding, leading the group sessions. The guide/ supervisor can be part of the teaching staff or be one of the group. This person can be also one allocated each meeting new. In our case we have chosen for a supervisor from the teaching staff as well as a conversation guide per meeting, who leads the meetings.

The community comes together  in a set period of time, in our case every week. In this time we are defining goals we want to achieve , such as in normal game development with SCRUM sprints. We then review in our meetings the last weeks work as well as define our individual achievements for the next week. In those meetings we are using a stand up like method, this means we debate the results of each individually, talk about what they have been blocked with and what they would need to progress further.  

The format itself is quite lose the only constant are the questions: *What have you been working on? Have you been blocked with what are you going to do next? What do you need?*

This allows us for adopting to changes in the learning, hence every week we reevaluate the format of the last week to adjust it for the next week.
