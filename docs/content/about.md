## Yet another game dev blog about data oriented design.
This is a blog of our Unity DOTS learning community at [Breda University of Applied Sciences - Games](https://www.buas.nl/en/programmes/creative-media-and-game-technologies). We are striving to understand and learn the guiding principles behind DOTS together and share the knowledge we are gathering with each other as well as everyone who wants to read this.
