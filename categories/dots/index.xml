Before we can actually answer that question, we should formulate the actual problem.
Summary There are two problems in an ECS when it comes to interaction between entities: read and write access. The truth is that interactions do not really exists, they hide the implementation of the underlaying relationship. A relationship is then nothing else than the transformation of data. (More about)
To reason about the right tool for creating those transformations, we need to reason about our code and ask ourselves the following five questions:</description></item><item><title>Linking entities or entity relationships</title><link>https://eothaun.github.io/DOTS-Playground/2019/11/linkingentities/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2019 14:59:02 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://eothaun.github.io/DOTS-Playground/2019/11/linkingentities/</guid><description>The problem Often in games different objects interact with each other, eg. a button opens a door, a child follows its parent etc. With the new ESC system those hierarchies aren&amp;rsquo;t trivial, hierarchies don&amp;rsquo;t really exist natively. So how do we link entities in a hierarchy?
Linking entities as a group In the new ESC if you translate a GameObject via ConvertToEntity to entities the hierarchy would not be translated into the ESC World.</description></item></channel></rss>
